## Usage

Once installed, the component can be used to create a question with one or more clickable tab based answers. Once the reader selects all their answers, the question may be submitted.

Upon submission, feedback will be provided. Feedback can be provided for correct, incorrect and partially correct answers.

If all answers are correct, no further learner interaction is available.

If one or more answers are incorrect, the user may reset their submission, and try again. The amount of times they can do this is determined by the ``_attempts`` setting. Subsequent submissions are treated as before, until the maximum number of attempts is reached. At this point, the user is presented with the opportunity to view the model answer, and compare this with their own submission.

Further submission is not available.
